## Resolving merge conflicts

When Git cannot automatically merge your changes, resolve the conflicts by following these steps:

1. Run `git status` to see which files are in conflict.
2. Open each conflicted file and remove the conflict markers, keeping the desired code.
3. Stage the corrected files with `git add`.
4. Finish the merge by committing the resolution with `git commit`.
