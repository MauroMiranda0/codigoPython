## Resolving Merge Conflicts

1. Run `git status` to see which files are conflicted.
2. Open each conflicted file and edit the sections marked by Git to keep the correct content.
3. When the conflicts are resolved, stage the files with `git add <files>`.
4. Commit the resolution using `git commit` with an explanatory message.

After committing, you can continue your workflow as usual.
